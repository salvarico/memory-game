# Memory Game Project

This project is for the [Udacity Front-End Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). It's using HTML, CSS and Javascript (no framework).

## Instructions

This game is about testing your memory skills. You will start with 16 cards faced down. Each of these cards contain a figure related with technology (or a cup of cofee). Each figure appears exactly in 2 cards for a total of 8 figures. The goal is to match each card with its pair. You can't have more than 2 unmatched cards faced up at a given time so whenever you turn a second card that has no match you will have to flip the 2 unmatched cards.

To play the game just clone the repository and open index.html:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/salvarico/memory-game.git
open index.html
```
or [start playing online](https://salvarico.github.io/memory-game/).

## Dependencies

I used [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for the figures, the stars and the redo icon in the project.

## Credits

The idea of the changeTimeFormat function was taken from [Matthew Canford](https://matthewcranford.com/), [@MatthewCanford](https://github.com/MatthewCranford) but done by myself. I also took the modal from him but commented out the code to avoid plagiarism.
